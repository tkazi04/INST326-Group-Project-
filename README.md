  <strong>Project: Campus Task Organizer Description</strong>
</div>
<br> 1: Our Campus Task Organizer is a phyton based program that is designed to help help students track and manage their academic tasks. 
<br> 2: In our program users can add, edit, delete, search, and complete tasks through a simple text-based menu interface.  
All tasks can be saved to and loaded from a JSON file so progress is never lost.
